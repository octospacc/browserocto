# browserocto

A small browser app for Android I created to be able to, for those that don't directly support it, quickly adapt websites I want to have as offline progressive web apps.

I still have to make the app more usable on older Android versions, add some missing basic features (custom shortcuts icon), and I think I plan on adding more unrelated features in the future.
