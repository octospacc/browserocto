# browserocto

A small browser app for Android I created to be able to, for those that don't directly support it, quickly adapt websites I want to have as offline progressive web apps.

I still have to make the app more usable on older Android versions, add some missing basic features (custom shortcuts icon), and I think I plan on adding more unrelated features in the future.

## Releases

Go to [-/releases](https://gitlab.com/octtspacc/browserocto) to get the latest built release APKs.

## Building

I fail to understand how to build apps supporting old minimum API targets with classic methods, to build from source then I suggest using this application: [AIDE- IDE for Android Java C++](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aide.ui) (it's what I'm using for development).
